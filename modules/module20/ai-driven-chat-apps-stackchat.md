**Authors: [Marcus Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus1robinson/), [Ian Dejong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-dejong-5408b57/), [Wouter Van Geluwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervangeluwe/)**

In this module, you'll build your own Luma chatbot using Stackchat. This module will take you through how to...

- Setup your Stackchat account
- Create your first Stackchat chatbot
- Build automated conversations & live chat
- Integrate your chatbot with the Luma website using  the Web Messenger
- Configure social channels so you can interact with your chatbot via Facebook and WeChat
- Integrate your chatbot with Adobe Experience Platform and other Experience Cloud products

As part of this module you'll setup a bi-direction integration between Stackchat and Adobe Experience Platform, allowing your chatbot to both send interaction data to Adobe Experience Platform and also, have Stackchat consume the Real-time Customer Profile via Adobe Experience Platform API's to help inform and personalize the conversation across web and social. To illustrate the end result, please check out the following video:

## An introduction to Stackchat

Customers have high expectations when it comes to brand interactions. They want instant answers to questions and they want to communicate on their terms across social and owned channels. Email forms and call centers no longer cut it on their own and brands who fail to offer real-time omni-channel chat as a communication channel cannot remain competitive in the customer experience space. [Stackchat](https://stackchat.com/enterprise) helps solve these needs by providing an enterprise grade, all-in-one conversational marketing platform to build, manage and optimize chat apps for your business using NLP AI & Live Chat capability through team collaboration, content pipelines and developer workflows.
