# 16.2 Create your first query in BigQuery

## Objectives

- Explore the BigQuery UI
- Create a SQL query within BigQuery
- Save your SQL query's results in a dataset within BigQuery

## Context

When Google Analytics data is in BigQuery, dimensions, metrics and other variables are all nested. Also, Google Analytics data is loaded daily into different tables. This means that trying to connect Google Analytics tables within BigQuery to Adobe Experience Platform directly is very hard and not a good idea.

The solution to this problem is to transform Google Analytics data into a readable format to make the ingestion into Adobe Experience Platform easier.

## Exercise 16.2.1 – Create a dataset to save new BigQuery Tables

Go to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).

![demo](./images/ex3/1.png)

In **Explorer**, you'll see your Project ID. Click your Project ID (don't click on the **bigquery-public-data** dataset).

![demo](./images/ex3/2.png)

You can see that there isn't a dataset yet, so let's create one now.
Click **CREATE DATASET**.

![demo](./images/ex3/4.png)

On the right side of your screen, you'll see the **Create dataset** menu.

![demo](./images/ex3/5.png)

For the **Dataset ID**, use the below naming convention. For the other fields, please leave the default settings.

| Naming         | Example |    
| ----------------- | ------------- | 
| ldap_BigQueryDataSets | vangeluw_BigQueryDataSets |  

![demo](./images/ex3/6.png)

Next, click **Create dataset**.

![demo](./images/ex3/7.png)

You'll then be back in the BigQuery Console with your dataset created.

![demo](./images/ex3/8.png)

## Exercise 16.2.2 – Create your first SQL BigQuery

Next, you'll create your first query in BigQuery. The goal of this query is to take the Google Analytics sample data and transform it so that it can be ingested in Adobe Experience Platform. Go to the **EDITOR** tab.

![demo](./images/ex3/9.png)

Please copy the following SQL query and paste it into that Query Editor. Feel free to read the query and understand the Google Analytics BigQuery syntax.


```sql

  CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(hitTime AS String), '-', hitNumber) AS _id,

```

When you are ready, click **Run** to run the query:

![demo](./images/ex3/10.png)

Executing the query can take a couple of minutes.

Once the query has finished running, you'll see the below output in the **Query results**.

![demo](./images/ex3/12.png)

## Exercise 16.2.3 – Save the results of your BigQuery SQL query

The next step is to save the output of your query by clicking the **SAVE RESULTS** button.

![demo](./images/ex3/13.png)

As the location for your output, select **BigQuery table**.

![demo](./images/ex3/14.png)

You'll then see a new popup, where your **Project Name** and **Dataset Name** are pre-populated. The dataset name should be the dataset that you created in the beginning of this exercise, with this naming convention:

| Naming         | Example |    
| ----------------- | ------------- | 
| `ldap_BigQueryDataSets` | `vangeluw_BigQueryDataSets` |  

You now need to enter a Table name. Please use this naming convention:

| Naming         | Example |    
| ----------------- |------------- | 
| `ldap_GAdataTableBigQuery` | `vangeluw_GAdataTableBigQuery` |  

![demo](./images/ex3/16.png)

Click **SAVE**.

It may take some time until the data is ready in the table you've created. After a couple of minutes, refresh the browser. You should then see within your dataset the `ldap_GAdataTableBigquery` table under **Explorer** inside your BigQuery project.

![demo](./images/ex3/19.png)

You con now continue with the next exercise, where you'll connect this table to Adobe Experience Platform.
