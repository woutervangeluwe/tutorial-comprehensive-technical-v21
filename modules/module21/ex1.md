# 21.1 Create an Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Adobe Experience Platform Edge mobile extension is currently in BETA. Use of this extension is by invitation only. Please contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager to learn more and get access to the materials for this tutorial.

## 21.1.1 What is a Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property?

Typically, when data is collected using Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection, it is collected on the **Client Side**. The **Client Side** is an environment such as a website or a mobile application. In Module 0 and Module 1, the configuration of a Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client property was discussed in depth and you implemented that Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client property onto your website and mobile application, so that data could be collected there when a customer was interacting with the website and mobile application.

When that interaction data is collected by the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client property, a request is sent by the website or mobile app to Adobe's Edge. The Edge is Adobe's Data Collection environment and is the entry-point for clickstream data into the Adobe ecosystem. From the Edge, that collected data is then sent to applications like Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager or Adobe Target. 

With the addition of an Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property, it's now possible to configure a Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection property that listens to incoming data on the Edge. When the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property that is running on the Edge sees incoming data, it has the ability to use that data and forward it to somewhere else. That somewhere else can now also be a non-Adobe external webhook, which makes it possible to send that data to for instance, your data lake of choice, a decisioning application, or any other application that has the ability to open up a webhook.

The configuration of a Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property looks familiar to a Client property, with the ability to configure data elements and rules just like in the past with Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client properties. However, the way that data will be accessed and used will be slightly different, depending on your use case.

Let's start by creating the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property.

## 21.1.2 Create a Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/](https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/). In the left menu, click **Event Forwarding**.

You'll then see an overview of all available Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding properties. Click the **New Property** button.

You now need to enter a name for your Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property. As a naming convention, use **ldap - Demo System (DD/MM/YYYY) (Edge)**. For instance, in this example, the name is **vangeluw - Demo System (30/06/2021) (Edge)**. Click **Save**.

You'll then be back in the list of Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding properties. Click to open the property you just created.

## 21.1.2 Configure the Adobe Cloud Connector extension

In the left menu, go to **Extensions**. You'll see that the **Core** extension is already configured.

The extension will then be added. There's no configuration to do at this step. You'll be sent back to the overview of installed extensions.

## 21.1.3 Deploy your Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Event Forwarding property

In the left menu, go to **Publishing Flow**. Click **Add Library**.

Enter the name **v1**, select the environment **Development (development)** and click **+ Add All Changed Resources**. 

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/ssf7.png)

You'll then see this. Click **Save & Build for Development**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/ssf8.png)

Your library will then be built, which might take a 1-2 minutes.
